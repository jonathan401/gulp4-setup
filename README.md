## Gulp Starter 4

##### my personal gulp 4 config setup

setup setting up

## starting the project

- run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install `devdependencies`
- run `gulp` to start the project

_There's still a lot of things to I have to learn about seting up `Gulp` but this setup is enough for me_
