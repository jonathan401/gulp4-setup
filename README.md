# Gulp Starter 4

my personal gulp 4 config setup

## starting the project

- run `git clone git@github.com:jonathan401/gulp4_starter.git` to download the repo to your local machine
- run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install `devdependencies`
- run `gulp` to start the project, A `dist` folder is automatically created

_There's still a lot of things to I have to learn about setting up `Gulp` but this setup is enough for me_
